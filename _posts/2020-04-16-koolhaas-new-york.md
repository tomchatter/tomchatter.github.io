Got contacted by a publisher recently. Rem Koolhaas' book on the contemporary architecture of Manhattan. They are very eager to publish this book in Lithuania, and I can see why. So here's to another translation project.
  
the principle of congestion

> "At the heart of Rockefeller Center--the first installment of that final, definitive Manhattan--is a double paradox that only Manhattanism could transcend [...]" <REF: Koolhaas, Rem () *Delirious New York*>

the timing of this project is eerie because
today congestion is recognised as the main culprit behind the pandemic
in fact, deBlasio himself said this about the situation in New York
I wonder whether this might be the time when the architectural paradigm of congestion is being complicated even further
